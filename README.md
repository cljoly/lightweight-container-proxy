# Lightweight Container Proxy
</div>

This firefox addon will, for each [tab container](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/multi-account-containers/) optionally redirect redirect traffic through a socks5 proxy.

The aim is to keep the code small to ease inspection. Have a look at the code yourself!

## Permission Request Explanations

- `Access your data for all websites` is required to proxy every request based on the container they originate from.
- `Control browser proxy settings` is required to set proxy  settings on the fly for each request.
